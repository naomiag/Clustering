# Clustering: Diabec

The case name is Diabec. The case explains that Diabec is a health organization 
that check whether a person has diabetes or not. The objective of this code is
to make cluster model, people with diabetes cluster and people without diabetes cluster.
I codded this using Google Collab and with Phyton. I learned clustering in my fourth semester,
on Big Data Processing course.

note: <br>
The Train.csv contains several columns, such as Glucose, DiabetesPedigreeFunction,
Insulin, TotalCholestrollLevel, LowerBackPain and SugarInTake/day.

The Test.csv contains same columns as Train.csv with one addition collumn, Outcome Column.
